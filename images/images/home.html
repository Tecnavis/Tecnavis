            Galle is a city on the southwest coast of Sri Lanka. Itâ€™s known for Galle Fort, the fortified old city founded by Portuguese colonists in the 16th century. Stone sea walls, expanded by the Dutch, encircle car-free
            streets with architecture reflecting Portuguese, Dutch and British rule.
